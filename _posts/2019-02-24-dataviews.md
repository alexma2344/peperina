# Data Views

*"A visual representation of data sets, created using CLI, SNMP and/or API"*

It replaces static worksheets in Visio with Dynamic Views.

eg:
- Routing
- QoS design
- STP


## 

*A server that you can use to retrieve and send data using code.*

It enables two pieces of software to communicate with each other, and its most commonly used to retrieve data.

Just like other network services, the API listens on a given port and [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). To which you target your requests.
