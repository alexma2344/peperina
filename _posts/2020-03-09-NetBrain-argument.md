## Pain Points

The following topics are for the overview demo.


### Inaccurate or incomplete documentation

Expedite pending audits and provide the engineers with accurate/up to date documentation.

### MTTI/MTTR to slow on outages

Reduce the time to recover from an Incident

> Gartner Research: Averge hourly cost network downtime is USD 300K.

### Response to security attacks

Too slow to detect inconsistencies, a golden baseline alert can pinpoint these and accelerate risk mitigation time.

### Self Inflicted outages

Even the most experienced engineers can make mistakes. 

### Lack of Know-how on technology

No knowledge on new technologies like SDN, IOT. NetBrain can help you automate/visualize these things.

### Lack of collaboration between teams

Use runbooks to troubleshoot, then save them and share with the rest of the team.


## Quantify Cost

- How much time and resources does this pain cost the organization.
- The cost of pain must be large enough to drive initiavive for change.
