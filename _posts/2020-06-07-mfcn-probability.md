##Outcomes

> Probability measures the degree of uncertainty about the potential *outcomes* of a *process*.

Example:

A rolling six-faced die, the **process** is that of rolling, the **outcome** is number on the upper horizontal page.

Outcome is "mutually exclusive" because there can be only one when rolling the die.

The sample space (S) goes from 1 to 6. 

S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Its size is |S| = 6

Each outcome is equally likely, and the probability of each outcome
