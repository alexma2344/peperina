## Outcomes

> Probability measures the degree of uncertainty about the potential *outcomes* of a *process*.

### Examples:

#### Die

A rolling six-faced die, the **process** is that of rolling, the **outcome** is number on the upper horizontal page.

Outcome is "mutually exclusive" because there can be only one when rolling the die.

The sample space (S) goes from 1 to 6. 

S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Its size is |S| = 6

Each outcome is equally likely, and the probability of each outcome is *1/|S| = 1/6*

#### Infinite sample space and zero probability

If you trow a dart at random on to a dartboard.

**Process:** Throwing a dart.
**Outcome:** Point where dart hits.

Outcome is mutually exclusive because the dart can only land on one point on the dartboard.

But the difference with the die example, is that in this case. The sample space S is infinite.

So, if every outcome is equally likely and there is an infinite amout of outcomes.

Then the outcomes of this process have a probability of Zero.
