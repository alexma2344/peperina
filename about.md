## Purpose

To melt multiple sources into comprehensible guides. 

I have missplaced most of the study notes I had in paper, and lost that one HDD that had everything.

The site acts as a single source of truth, accessible from anywhere and backed up on a [free & open source unified file and block storage, VM, and Docker system](https://www.freenas.org/)
